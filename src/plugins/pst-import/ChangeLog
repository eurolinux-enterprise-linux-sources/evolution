	* Makefile.am: On Windows use -no-undefined and link with all
	required libraries. (Just throw in a bunch of libraries without
	cherry-picking. Having "superfluous" ones just slows down the
	linking a bit, but doesn't hurt at run-time.)

	Use LIBPST_CFLAGS.

	* pst-importer.c: Include <libpst/define.h> before the other
	libpst headers. Otherwise we get compilation errors on Windows,
	sigh.
